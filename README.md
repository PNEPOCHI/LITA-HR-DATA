### project overview
To analyze employee data to uncover trends and insights related to attrition, satisfaction, and performance. The project aims to help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and optimize workforce strategies.

### data source
This Dataset will be given on the repository. This entails Employee data (which include Attrition, Age band, current employee etc.).

### data tool
Power BI for data visualization

### data preparation
•	Load Data: Import the HR Data sheet into Power BI.
•	Transform Data:
-	Promoted Header.
-	Added calculated columns as needed such as 
-	Created Measures
-	Ensure data types are set correctly (e.g., numeric values, dates, categorical fields).
-	 Added calculated columns as needed such as Job satisfaction rating, Age sort

 ### exploratory data analysis 
 -	what is the total number of Employee
-	What is the average age
-	What is the Attrition by Department
-	What is the attrition by educational field
-	What is the Attrition Rate by Gender
-	What is the attrition rate under 25

  ### data analysis
#### Total Number of Employees:
•	Total Number of Employees: The organization has 1,470 employees in total.

•	Total Number of Current Employees: 1,233 employees are currently with the company.

•	Total Number of Attrition Count: There have been 237 employees who have left the company, which represents an attrition rate of 16%.
#### Average Age:
•	The average age of the employees is 38 years. This suggests a mid-career workforce, which could be indicative of experienced professionals or a potential group that values job stability.
#### Attrition by Department:
•	The pie chart shows that attrition is higher in some departments:
-	HR Department: Has the highest attrition count, with 133 employees (56.12% of total attrition).
  
-	R&D Department: 92 employees (38.8% of attrition) have left.
-	
-	Sales Department: Shows a lower attrition count.
  
This insight is critical for identifying departments that may need targeted retention strategies or further investigation into the causes of turnover.
#### Attrition by Educational Field:
•	Life Sciences has the highest attrition (89 employees), followed by Medical (63) and Marketing (35).

•	Fields like Human Resources and Other show relatively low attrition numbers.

•	This analysis could help HR understand if specific educational backgrounds are linked to higher turnover and tailor interventions accordingly.
#### Gender-Based Attrition:
•	The data shows that 150 males (63.2%) and 87 females (36.8%) have left the company.

•	This disparity may prompt further analysis to understand whether there is gender-specific issues contributing to turnover.
#### Attrition Under 25:
•	A small portion of the attrition (38 employees) consists of those under 25 years of age.This group includes 20 males and 18 females. The low numbers suggest that younger employees may have a different set of expectations or motivations than the overall workforce.
